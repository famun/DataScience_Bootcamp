# DataScience_Bootcamp Project
# Name
Study of the Obesity rate in the United States
# Goal
The goal of this project is to gain an insight into the obesity rate in the United States for a set of years and relate it to different factors like the education and the income
# Dataset
The data was obtained from Kaggle and originally the data is from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, it contains several features from the location to some questions gained from surveys with their own data value which is the answers and so on.
# Work flow
We start the project by first reading the file then checking for missing values and any outliers, then drop any unncessary features that will not help us in finding a link between the obesity rates and the education or income.
Afterwards, performing EDA analysis to plot and visualize the dataset to further understand the corrolation we seek, at first we look at a certain year that has the most data values and seperate it from the rest, then we use this year to find which state had the most and least obesity rates. After that, we seperate the income and education and see how one's level of education can affect their own obesity rate and income as well.
# Model
A linear regression model is used to predict the regression coeffecients for the education levels and different incomes for the chosen year
# Questions that the project will answer
How does pursuing higher education affect the obesity? if one had more wealth does their risk of obesity increase or decrease? what can a person do to help prevent obesity (gain education or income), which states suffer from obesity the most? what is the national average for obesity in the USA?
